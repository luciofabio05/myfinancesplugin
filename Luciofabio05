# My Finances Official Plugin
Plugin for My Finances Official app.
This plugin makes it possible  to you to develop mechanisms to import transactions to My Finances app.
If you are Brazillian, you can develop a special way to import a SMS or bank notification for example.

**It works with My Finances app version 4.4.5 or above.**

First Of All
------

You have to install the My Finances Official app to test this library.
It is available on Google Play Store.

**Download My Finances**

[![PlayStore](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/badge_new.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cicero.minhasfinancas)

**1. Install [My Finances Offcial](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cicero.minhasfinancas) app**

**2. Go to Settings > Security > Enable MF Plugin**

Features
-----
- Add transactions (incomes, expenses and transfers) to the app.
 
Usage
-----

In order to use the library, there are 2 different options:

**1. Gradle dependency** (recommended)

  -  Add the following to your project level `build.gradle`:
 
```gradle
allprojects {
	repositories {
		maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```
  -  Add this to your app `build.gradle`:
 
```gradle
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.ciceromsjr:myfinancesplugin:v0.0.2'
}
```
	
**2. clone whole repository** (not recommended)

ADDING TRANSACTIONS
-----

You can add three transaction types:

- Income
- Expense
- Transfer

All dependecies such as account, category/subcategory, and credit card are found by description
(credit cards can also be found by its 4 final digits registered on MF app).
It means that if a dependency is not found you will get an error.
Nevertheless, you can set the ```createDependenciesIfNeeded``` transaction property as ```true``` to tell MF app to create the transaction dependencies if they are not found.  
**It does not work for credit cards because credit cards need more information to be created. You must do it on the MF app or tell the user to do it**

**ADDING AN INCOME**

```
IncomeTransaction income = new IncomeTransaction();
income.setDescription("Sale Bonus");
income.setAmount(50d);
income.setConfirmationDate(new Date());
income.setCreationDate(new Date());
income.setDueDate(new Date());
income.setAccount("My Account");
income.setCategory("Sales");
income.setSubcategory("Others");
income.setRecurrence(Transaction.TransactionRecurrence.NONE); //default

new TransactionSender.Builder(this)
                    .notification(true) //only for incomes and expenses
                    .transaction(income)
                    .build()
                    .send();

```

**ADDING AN EXPENSE**

```
ExpenseTransaction expense = new ExpenseTransaction();
expense.setDescription("Nike Shoes");
expense.setAmount(90d);
expense.setConfirmationDate(new Date());
expense.setCreationDate(new Date());
expense.setDueDate(new Date());
expense.setAccount("My Account");
expense.setCategory("Chothing");
expense.setSubcategory("Shoes");
//it will create three expenses of $30
//if the due date is old the expense will be marked as paid even if you do not set the confirmation date
expense.setRecurrence(Transaction.TransactionRecurrence.INSTALLMENTS);
expense.setInstallmentsCount(3); 

//If you want to set a credit card to the expense, the due date MUST be the due date of the credit card invoice

new TransactionSender.Builder(this)
                    .notification(true)
                    .transaction(expense)
                    .build()
                    .send();

```

**ADDING A TRANSFER BETWEEN ACCOUNTS**

```
TransferTransaction transfer = new TransferTransaction();
transfer.setDescription("Got some money at ATM");
transfer.setAmount(100d);
transfer.setConfirmationDate(new Date());
transfer.setCreationDate(new Date());
transfer.setDueDate(new Date());
transfer.setSourceAccount("My Account");
transfer.setTargetAccount("My Wallet");

new TransactionSender.Builder(this)
                    .transaction(transfer)
                    .build()
                    .send();

```

**ADDING MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS**

You can also add as much transactions as you want to.

```

new TransactionSender.Builder(this)
                    .transactions(income, expense, transfer)
                    .build()
                    .send();

```

or

```

ArrayList<Transaction> transactions = new ArrayList<>();
transactions.add(income);
transactions.add(expense);
transactions.add(transfer);

new TransactionSender.Builder(this)
                    .transactions(transactions)
                    .build()
                    .send();

```

**Be careful about how much transactions you send to MF. This process is done using BroadcastReceiver and although it is carried out in background using ```goAsync()```, the time to execute any task inside a BroadcastReceiver is limited and it gets harder on Android Oreo. See the [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver.html#goAsync()) about it.**

GETTING THE REQUEST RESULT
-----

You have to register a broadcast receiver on your manifest with the action  ```cicero.minhasfinancas.action.ADD_TRANSACTION_RESULT``` to get the request result.

You can get the result calling ```intent.getStringExtra("result")``` which is a message that tells you about your request.


**MyBroadcastReceiver.java**

```

public class MyBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

    public static final String ADD_TRANSACTION_RESULT = "cicero.minhasfinancas.action.ADD_TRANSACTION_RESULT";

    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {

        if (intent.getAction() != null && intent.getAction().equals(ADD_TRANSACTION_RESULT)) {
            
	    String result = intent.getStringExtra("result");
            
	    //do something (log, toast, etc.)
	    Toast.makeText(context, result, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
    }
}

```


**AndroidManifest.xml**

```

<application ...>
	
	...
	
       <receiver
            android:name=".MyBroadcastReceiver"
            android:enabled="true"
            android:exported="true">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="cicero.minhasfinancas.action.ADD_TRANSACTION_RESULT" />
            </intent-filter>
        </receiver>

</application>

```

**In addition, you can donwload the project to see it all working with the sample app. Try it out!**
